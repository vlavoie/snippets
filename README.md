# vl/snippets

This repo contains some extracted code snippets that I use when coding for personal usage. This is mostly for personal use and my own portfolio, but you can study and use this if you stumbled upon here.

A lot of inspiration was drawn from [nothings/stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb), [Handmade Hero](https://hero.handmade.network/) and other sources.

## Examples

The examples folder contains implementation examples with their build scripts. I use these small CLI programs to test changes in a non-automated way for now.

## Requirements

* Clang
* C++14 or later
* X11 (For image example)
* Pulse Audio (For audio example)

All examples were written and built on Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, compabitility is not guaranteed on other platforms.
